## Recommended Strategy

### Priority 1: MVP (Hours 1-4)
**Goal:** Working demo with 6 sponsor tools

**Focus:**
- Core company analysis (6 categories)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Neo4j knowledge graph
- Clean UI with 3+ tabs working
- Deploy to Render

**Why:** This alone wins prizes. It's complete, demoable, and meets all requirements.

### Priority 2: Pre-cache Companies (30 min before demo)
**Goal:** Instant demos for backup

**Companies to cache:**
- Stripe (best demo)
- OpenAI (AI company)
- Shopify (e-commerce)
- Twilio (API company)
- Vercel (developer tools)

**Why:** If live demo fails or APIs rate limit, you have instant fallback.

### Priority 3: Step 2 - Modulate (Hour 5, if time permits)
**Goal:** Add voice intelligence for differentiation

**Why:** 
- Unique feature (voice analysis)
- Shows creativity
- Targets Modulate prize track
- Adds 7th sponsor tool

**Risk:** Medium - Modulate API might be complex

### Priority 4: Step 3 - Fastino Labs (Hour 6, if time permits)
**Goal:** Enhanced entity extraction and AI insights

**Why:**
- Better data quality
- AI-powered insights
- Targets Fastino prize track
- Adds 8th sponsor tool

**Risk:** Low - Fastino API is straightforward

## Demo Script (3 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [name] and we built CompanyIntel - a comprehensive company intelligence platform powered by autonomous AI agents.

Imagine you're a developer evaluating APIs, a salesperson researching prospects, or an investor doing due diligence. You need to understand a company's products, APIs, competitors, financials, team, and market position. This normally takes 5+ hours of manual research.

Watch this..."

### Live Demo (90 seconds)
[Type "Stripe" in search box]

"Our autonomous agents spring into action. Watch the real-time progress:
- Stage 1: Yutori Research API gathers company overview
- Stage 2: Yutori Browsing API extracts 200+ API endpoints
- Stage 3: Analyzing 5 direct competitors
- Stage 4: Gathering financial data - $14B revenue, $50B valuation
- Stage 5: Extracting team info and tech stack
- Stage 6: Processing news sentiment from 50+ sources
- Stage 7: Building Neo4j knowledge graph with 8 relationship types

[Dashboard appears]

Here's the complete intelligence report:
- [Click Overview] Company founded 2010, 7,000+ employees
- [Click APIs] 200+ endpoints cataloged, pricing tiers extracted
- [Click Market] 5 competitors analyzed with strengths/weaknesses
- [Click Financials] $14B revenue, growing 50% YoY
- [Click Team] Leadership profiles, tech stack (Ruby, React, Postgres)
- [Click News] 85% positive sentiment, trending up

[Click Knowledge Graph]

And here's the Neo4j knowledge graph - companies, products, competitors, people, technologies - all connected. Click any node to explore relationships."

### Technical Explanation (45 seconds)
"Under the hood:
- 3 Yutori APIs working in parallel - Research, Browsing, and Scouting
- Neo4j stores 8 relationship types in a graph database
- Tavily searches 8+ data sources for real-time information
- OpenAI analyzes sentiment and extracts insights
- Deployed on Render with 5 features: Web Service, Background Workers, Cron Jobs, PostgreSQL, and Redis
- Processes everything in 30 seconds with autonomous agents

The agents operate independently - no manual intervention. They gather data, analyze it, build the graph, and present insights automatically."

### Business Value (15 seconds)
"This saves 5+ hours per company research. It serves sales teams, developers, investors, and job seekers. The market opportunity is $500M+ in B2B intelligence.

Thank you!"

1. **Switch to pre-cached company** (Stripe) - instant load
2. **Show video recording** of working demo
3. **Walk through screenshots** with narration

### If API Rate Limits Hit
1. **Use cached companies only**
2. **Explain:** "In production, we'd have higher API limits"
3. **Show architecture diagram** to explain how it works

### If Graph Doesn't Render
1. **Show data in table format**

## Questions Judges Might Ask

### Technical Questions

**Q: "How do you handle API rate limits?"**
A: "We implement exponential backoff and caching. Redis stores results for 1 hour. For production, we'd use API key rotation and request queuing."

**Q: "What if Yutori API is slow?"**
A: "We run all services in parallel using asyncio. If one is slow, others continue. We also have timeout handling and fallback to cached data."

**Q: "How does the Neo4j graph scale?"**
A: "We use indexed queries and limit graph depth to 2-3 levels. For large graphs, we implement pagination and lazy loading of nodes."

**Q: "Why FastAPI over Flask?"**
A: "FastAPI provides async support out of the box, automatic API documentation, and better performance. Perfect for our parallel API calls."

### Business Questions

**Q: "Who would pay for this?"**
A: "Sales teams ($50/user/month), developer platforms ($500/month for API intelligence), investors ($1000/month for due diligence), recruiters ($200/month for company research)."

**Q: "What's your competitive advantage?"**
A: "We're the only platform combining API documentation extraction, competitor analysis, and knowledge graphs in one autonomous system. Competitors focus on one vertical."

**Q: "How would you monetize?"**
A: "Freemium model: 5 free company analyses/month, then $49/month for unlimited. Enterprise tier at $499/month with API access and custom integrations."

### Product Questions

**Q: "What's the most valuable feature?"**
A: "API documentation extraction. Developers spend hours reading docs - we extract and catalog everything automatically. That alone saves 2-3 hours per evaluation."

**Q: "What would you build next?"**
A: "1) Comparison mode (side-by-side company analysis), 2) Alerts (notify when competitor launches new product), 3) Export to PDF/Notion/Slack."

**Q: "How accurate is the data?"**
A: "We aggregate from 8+ sources and show confidence scores. For critical data (financials), we cite sources. Users can verify and flag inaccuracies."

## Final Recommendations

### Do This
1. ✅ **Stick with your MVP design** - it's excellent
2. ✅ **Pre-cache 10-15 companies** - critical for demo reliability
3. ✅ **Practice your 3-minute pitch** - timing is everything
4. ✅ **Emphasize Render features** - you use 5, showcase them
5. ✅ **Highlight Yutori uniqueness** - all 3 APIs in one project
6. ✅ **Show Neo4j graph early** - visual wow factor
7. ✅ **Have backup plans** - cached companies, video, screenshots

### Don't Do This
1. ❌ **Don't add new features during hackathon** - focus on polish
2. ❌ **Don't rely on live API calls only** - pre-cache demos
3. ❌ **Don't go over 3 minutes** - judges will cut you off
4. ❌ **Don't skip error handling** - demos always break
5. ❌ **Don't forget to submit on time** - 4:30 PM sharp

### If You Have Extra Time
1. **Hour 5:** Add Modulate voice analysis (Step 2)
2. **Hour 6:** Add Fastino entity extraction (Step 3)
3. **Polish:** Better error messages, loading states, animations
4. **Content:** Pre-cache 15 companies instead of 10
5. **Video:** Record backup demo video
